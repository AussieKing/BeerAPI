## Overview

This API application was designed to return info on Beer objects in a database. It was created using C# and .NET Core. The application uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure. The application can be tested using Postman or Insomnia.mmm

Recently the application had FluentValidation added to it to validate the incoming data. This was done to ensure that the data being sent to the database is valid and to prevent any errors.
Also, Dependency Injection was added, by registering the `BeerValidator` so that it is automatically used by ASP.NET Core to validate the `Beer` object when it is passed to the `CreateBeer` method.

## Technologies Used

  - C#
  - .NET Core
  - ASP.NET Core
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Git
  - Insomnia 

## Usage

This Application is not designed to work with a front-end. The backend is designed to be tested using Insomnia or Postman.

The API routes are as below.
Please make sure to add to your usual server url.

```
http://localhost:5244/
```

### Routes

```
GET ..api/beers/{id} - returns the beer with the specified {id}
POST ../api/beers - creates a user by providing Name, Price, and PromoPrice (optional)
PUT ../api/api/beers/{id}/promo-price - updates a beer promo price by specifying their id
DELETE ..api/beers/{id} - deletes a beer by specifying their id
```


## Installation

1. Clone the Repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/AussieKing/BeerAPI.git) by using the Git Clone command.
2. Open the cloned repository in your code editor of choice (I used VS Code).
3. Open the integrated terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:

``` bash
dotnet build
dotnet watch run
```

4. If you're on Mac, also run the following in the terminal (from the root directory)

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust 
```

5. Use Insomnia to test the api routes.

## USER STORY
You are a developer in our e-commerce team. We are tasked to build the Shopping Trolley
feature. The requirements given as a user stories as below.
Your task is to design and develop this feature. 
You have the freedom to do it anyway you want and demonstrate, show us your strengths. 
Few suggestions are:

a. Build one or more libraries or services
b. Build one or more APIs / services
c. Choose an appropriate hosting environment - this can be just running in your favorite IDE, containers in your local machines or hosted in your favourite cloud environment
d. Optionally build a single page app or a web front end
e. Optionally deploy your application with build pipelines
f. Optionally build dashboards to monitor your services and application
	
Like true agile teams, we prioritise and build our features in small iterations. 
The user stories build up to provide richer experience with each adding some enhancements.

We care a lot about clean design, clean code, good tests and continuous delivery practices.
Demonstrate your strengths in these aspects.

#### Trolley Use Cases:
User Story 1:
As a customer I want to add / remove items to the trolley so that I can purchase the drinks
want.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1	. Customers can add the same item more than once. For MVP, there is no upper limit on the number of items or quantity they add [x]

2	. When customer adds an item to the trolley, they can see the count of items incremented. [x] --> `AddItem` does this
	a. Given customer has no item in the trolley 
	b. When they add the first item
	c. Then the trolley count shows 1 [x] --> `AddItemToTrolley` in `TrolleyController` does this
 
3	. When Customer removes item from the trolley, the count of items is decremented [x] --> `RemoveItem` does this
	a. Given customer has 1 item in the trolley
	b. When they remove that item from the trolley
	c. Then the trolley count shows [x] --> `PrintTrolleyState` does this

## SCREENSHOTS
- ADD Beer item to Trolley :

### DEV COMMENTS 
We write test cases against Services, as this is where all the logic is. Only dealing with the interface allows for more flexibility.
Every unit testing consists of Setup, Act, Verify (3 steps),
Use test explores in VS.

#### TODO:
- Invoke the service methods within a designated testing area (to be creaed, like Gurdip showed me today with Setup, Act, Verify), to test TrolleyService;

- Have a read of UNIT TESTING nd UNIT TEST , and circle back with So on Thursday. (Hint: look at packages)

### PSEUDO CODING

I'll use xUnit for Testing. 
I'll need to create a new project in the solution (`dotnet new xunit -n BeerAPI.Tests -o tests/BeerAPI.Tests`), for testing and main project. Will be working on branch feature-testing. 
Add the test prj to the solution (`dotnet sln add ./tests/BeerAPI.Tests/BeerAPI.Tests.csproj`).
Can also add reference (`dotnet add ./tests/BeerAPI.Tests/BeerAPI.Tests.csproj reference ./src/BeerAPI/BeerAPI.csproj`), so that it can access classes and methods in the main prj.
Then, create a new Library (hint: use `dotnet new classlib`), and a new xUnit test project (`dotnet new xunit`), and add to Solution.
Write tests (I can write basic tests using  [Fact] for individual test cases and [Theory] along with [InlineData] for parameterized tests that can be run with different inputs).
`Moq` is needed to setup the expected behaviour.
As per Test-Driven Development (TDD) best practice, I can start with writing failing tests, then code to pass the test, then refactor. 
The next step is to write continuous testing.
Make sure to name the tests clearly (eg: `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`), organize them logically, and avoid complicating them too much.

### TESTING
Feedback:
Unit Tests need to be in the different project, so that they are not in production.
Other Unit Testings I could practice on:

BeersController 
- BeersController: 
	- Test getting beer by ID
	- Test response when ID is not found (404)
- AddBeer:
	- Test adding a valid beer (200)
	- Test adding a beer with invalid data (400)
	- Test adding a beer with missing mandatory data 
- DeleteBeer:
	- Test response when ID is not found (404)
	- Test response when ID is found (201)
- UpdateBeer:
	- Test response whit a valid promo price
	- Test response whit an ivalid promo price (price less than half of the normal price)
	- Test response when ID is found (404)

TrolleyController
- AddToTrolley:
	- Test adding an existing beer to the trolley
	- Test adding a new beer to the trolley
- RemoveItemFromTrolley:
	- Test removing an item that exists from the trolley
	- Test removing an item that does not exist from the trolley (404)
	- Test removing item from an empty trolley
- GetTrolley:
	- Test getting the trolley when it is empty
	- Test getting the trolley when it has items

Services
- BeerService:
	- Test getting all beers
	- Test CRUD operations and that lists updates
- BeerDescriptionService: 
	- Test getting descriptions for items(with promo and without promo prices)
- TrolleyService:
	- Test adding an item to the trolley
	- Test removing an item from the trolley
	- Test getting the trolley when it is empty
	- Test getting the trolley when it has items

Validators
- BeerValidator:
	- Test validation logic based on requirements

Models
- Beer and TrolleyItem:
	- Test that the models are created correctly
	- Test that the models are created with the correct properties



### REVIEW
Life Cycle 
- Review Logic : what happens when multiple users using the same trolley? need to be able to add and remove items from the trolley. How can you keep the data but keep the trolley service in scope?
- RESTful naming convetions
